It is a User Centric Frontend Development Project, using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4.1.1, D3.js, DC.js, Crossfilter. I got the data unformatted from media sources (newspaper reports) and converted it in JSON data.","","UX Design","Initial idea sprung from my interest in infant mortality rates in Mother & Baby Homes in Ireland, due to the large amount of media attention and discontent amongst the survivors of the Magdalene Laundries, who operated a number of Maternity Homes (Mother & Baby) between 1935-1971. I looked at two sources of death records from 1935 to 1971 across two homes. As the dataset was very large, I specifically selected the data from 1950-1955 for the two homes to do a data comparison student and selection according to Home, Gender, Years.","","I tried to visualise and understand the User Experience, (UXE) and what a typical user looking at a data visualisation dashboard would want to find. I used the 5 Planes of UX design to help with analysing this. In addition, I set out to ask the same questions that many 'users' looking at my data visualisation charts would ask, such as:-","","(1)How many infants died in Home A and Home B? (2)Which home had the highest infant mortality rates? (3)Which gender had the highest mortality? (4)Did the mortality rate decrease from 1950, or did it rise again? (4)Number of female infant deaths per home? (5)Number of male infant deaths per home?","","For direction in UX design, I revised the Code Institute tutorials, and also referred to this website about user experience, Red Rocket Web Specialist, who consider that the two most important aspects of designing a good website are (1) the Abstract aspect (idea, goal, etc) and (2) the Concrete aspect (how to get a user to click on a link, etc). The transition from Abstract to Concrete should remain linear to ensure a smooth transition, with each phase being fluid and overlapping.","","Garret's 5 Planes of UX design are as follows:-","","Strategy (The goal)","The goal of the Dashboard Project is to portray the level of infant mortality in a comparison study across two Mother and Baby Homes between 1950-1955. It is to inform users of the dashboard of the occurrences of deaths using Interactive DC charts, which interact with each other.","","Scope (What tasks can be done)","The tasks that can be accomplished on the Dashboard involve seeing how the charts interact. For example clicking on the composite or Pie chart in a specific range will result in similar range of data in all the other charts.","","Structure (Plan or Flow of Interactions)","This is the plan or flow of interactions users will take to navigate and understand a website. A structure typically contains both a site map and a flow chart. To this end I tried to visualise the website, firstly in my mind and then on paper, by doing some mock-up sketches.","","Initial dashboard layout - photo","","Initial dashboard layout - grid","","Sketch for Dashboard","","Skeleton","In this section, I tried to place the elements in appropriate places, and in a logical order – such as navbar, then heading, then brief explanation of the project using unordered listing. I used MockFlow tool to detail page by page the type of layout I wanted to have across all pages in the website.","","Wireframe for Dashboard","","Surface","The surface, or the skin – is the interface for which visitors will engage with the dashboard. All typography was in English but as Google has a translator, can be easily translated. I particularly choose a congruent colour scheme (purple for navbar and footer and lighter shades for body and drop down menus in the dashboard), which I felt gave an appropriate overall appearance.","","What does it do?","The dashboard is a data visualisation project, which allows users to view charts that are interactive (composite, line, pie, row-selector and stack bar chart).","","How does it work","The dashboard data visualisation project uses HTML5, CSS3, D3.js, DC.js, Crossfilter. On viewing the dashboard, it can be seen how the charts interact. DC charting is not responsive on mobile phones, however, I've done a lot of research and looked at various fixes and resizing and came to the conclusion that bootstrap indeed has it's own fix for the charts and re-sizes them appropriately. For this project, it is not a requirement to have the charts mobile responsive. However, on testing the responsiveness of the charts, they appear responsive across mobile devices.","","D3.js","'D3.js is a data driven javascript library for Dom manipulating, which comes with a large set of advanced features, enabling the quick calculation and rendering of very large data sets. Or to quote the documentation: \"D3 allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction.\"' ***Quoted *** Busy People.","","DC.js and Crossfilter","'DC.js is a javascript charting library with native crossfilter support, allowing highly efficient exploration on large multi-dimensional datasets (inspired by crossfilter's demo). It leverages d3 to render charts in CSS-friendly SVG format. Charts rendered using dc.js are data driven and reactive and therefore provide instant feedback to user interaction. DC.js is an easy yet powerful javascript library for data visualization and analysis in the browser and on mobile devices'. ***Quoted *** CrossFilter.","","Version Status","","Features","Existing Features","Congruent Color Scheme (Purple and compatible shades) with white highlighting drop down menu choices for the various charts.","Good explanation of the project and what it tried to portray.","Interactive DC charts (Composite, Line, Pie, Row Selection, Stack Bar Chart).","Analysis and comparison of infant deaths in each and both homes A & B across dimensions, such as Gender.","Features Left to Implement","None","Tech Used","Technologies used includes:","HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, HTML5, D3.js, DC.js, Crossfilter","Base languages used to create website. HTML5","","Used HTML5 to handle page routing and to build custom directives. Bootstrap 4.1.1","Used Bootstrap to give our project a simple, responsive layout. CSS3","Used CSS3 for styling and enhancing the look of the website. Font-Awesome","Used Font-Awesome for adding to style to icons. JSON","Used JSON for converting data from newspapers in JSON data for project. Javascript","Used Javascript for boostrap.min.js, d3.min.js, dc.min.js, queue.min.js, graph.js. JQuery","Used JQuery to resize the graphs, so that they would be responsive on mobile devices. However, I am not sure if that is why they are responsive, as I also referred to other sources for guidance on responsiveness. D3.js","Used D3 for manipulating documents based on data and bringing data to life. DC.js","Used CSS3 for dimensional charting. Crossfilter","Used Crossfilter for fast multi-dimensional filtering for co-ordinated views.","Testing","From a testing view-point, I've tested responsiveness on both mobile and desktop, in a variety of screen sizes. The DC charts are not natively mobile responsive, however they are responsive in mobile views.","","Google Chrome (version 68)","Opera (version 55)","Mozilla Firefox Developer (version 63)","Internet Explorer (version 11)","Testing across desktop (using developer tools) and mobile browsers I have tested the Dashboard Data Visualisation Project on the above desktop browsers, and it works fine. I also tested on mobile browsers, however on mobile Firefox, although the DC charts rendered as responsive, on mobile Firefox the x-axis appeared distorted, however on mobile Chrome did not appear and the charts rendered perfectly. I used both Firefox and Chrome Developer tools to test the website in responsive mode - Apple iPad Air2, Apple iPad Mini2, Apple iPad iPhone 6s, Google nexus 4,5,6,7, Laptop (1280 x 720 and 1366 x 768), Nokia Lumia 520, Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Samsung Galaxy S5 and S7 and overall the Dashboard renders well in responsive mode.","","Regarding the responsiveness of the DC graphs, for this project, that wasn't a requirement, as typically DC charts aren't responsive. However, I did want to have them responsive, so I undertook quite a lot of research. I eventually looked at the following sources and used one option for resizing using JQuery but I also looked at how bootstrap grids already pre-determine the width of the charts, so instead of hard-coding width dimensions, I omitted to give width and just used height. As the Parent element is nested in a bootstrap row, the widths are calculated via bootstrap grid and there is no need to hard code. On rendering, the width and height are adjusted, to fill up the grid. Either as a result of JQuery solution or because of bootstrap's own resizing mechanism, the charts are responsive. See 'Credits' section below.","","Interactiveness of Charts I tested across all browsers (on both mobile and desktop) that the charts interacted, and they do. Crossfiltering also is applied to all charts and renders well across all browsers. I tested on mobile in both portrait and landscape mode.","","Jasmine testing","","I instigated tests for dimensions such as height and weight, as well as ensuring that a SVG had been created, and that the charts had the correct height and weight. \"D3.js is a data driven javascript library for Dom manipulating, and allows binding data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. For example, D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers, or use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction.\" ***Quoted *** Busy People.","","Underlying all forms of charts (Pie, Bar, Scatterplot, etc) there is an SVG at the source, which can then be manipulated to create various charts and shapes. The SVG not always obvious but on inspecting the DOM it should be seen as created. Hence, Jasmine testing starts with the SVG and using whatever graph is to be tested (ie) BarChart, etc, as a function (basically re-writing the code to make it testable).","","For testing, I created a folder for 'scripts' (with charts.js), and another folder for spec (with ChartsSpec.js). I created also a SpecRunner.html file to do the testing.","","Version Control (GitHub)","I used version control on an ongoing basis to back-up my code to a remote repository and used version control at regular intervals throughout development of the dashboard data visualisation project.","","Deployment","This project was developed in Cloud9 IDE. I used Gh-pages to deploy the website - Link to Data Visualisation Project","","Information","I viewed online sources of data (death records) for this project, which were unformatted to do a project such as this, but I used JSON to format the data. All the data sources for this project can be viewed in \"data-sources.md\" – Data Sources","","How to run the code in this project","To view the Dashboard Database, simply run it from 'Index.html'. To view Jasmine testing, run it from 'SpecRunner.html'.","","Credits","Content","The content contained in the project is mainly my own and anywhere I've used any outside references, I've made reference to them (as in this README document).","","Code","I based the project on code I learned throughout the course from the tutorials of Code Institute and by referring to the lessons. For the Login and Sign-up Modals and anything else I needed to get guidance on, I used W3Schools and also on occasion I referred to Stack Overflow.","I also referred to the following website for guidance on Jasmine Testing for D3.JS and for each of the graphs - Busy People.","The following are the sources I referred to for re-sizing - StackOverflow Contributor.

due to the large amount of media attention and discontent amongst the survivors of the Magdalene Laundries, who operated a number of Maternity Homes (Mother & Baby) between 1935-1971.

As the dataset was very large, I specifically selected the data from 1950-1955 for the two homes to do a data comparison student and selection according to Home, Gender, Years.","","I tried to visualise and understand the User Experience, (UXE) and what a typical user looking at a data visualisation dashboard would want to find. I used the 5 Planes of UX design to help with analysing this. In addition, I set out to ask the same questions that many 'users' looking at my data visualisation charts would ask, such as:-","","(1)How many infants died in Home A and Home B? (2)Which home had the highest infant mortality rates? (3)Which gender had the highest mortality? (4)Did the mortality rate decrease from 1950, or did it rise again? (4)Number of female infant deaths per home? (5)Number of male infant deaths per home?","","For direction in UX design, I revised the Code Institute tutorials, and also referred to this website about user experience, Red Rocket Web Specialist, who consider that the two most important aspects of designing a good website are (1) the Abstract aspect (idea, goal, etc) and (2) the Concrete aspect (how to get a user to click on a link, etc). The transition from Abstract to Concrete should remain linear to ensure a smooth transition, with each phase being fluid and overlapping."],"id":77}],[{"start":{"row":17,"column":0},"end":{"row":67,"column":77},"action":"remove","lines":["Initial dashboard layout - photo","","Initial dashboard layout - grid","","Sketch for Dashboard","","Skeleton","In this section, I tried to place the elements in appropriate places, and in a logical order – such as navbar, then heading, then brief explanation of the project using unordered listing.

On viewing the dashboard, it can be seen how the charts interact. DC charting is not responsive on mobile phones, however, I've done a lot of research and looked at various fixes and resizing and came to the conclusion that bootstrap indeed has it's own fix for the charts and re-sizes them appropriately. For this project, it is not a requirement to have the charts mobile responsive. However, on testing the responsiveness of the charts, they appear responsive across mobile devices.","","D3.js","'D3.js is a data driven javascript library for Dom manipulating, which comes with a large set of advanced features, enabling the quick calculation and rendering of very large data sets. Or to quote the documentation: \"D3 allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. For example, you can use D3 to generate an HTML table from an array of numbers. Or, use the same data to create an interactive SVG bar chart with smooth transitions and interaction.\"' ***Quoted *** Busy People.","","DC.js and Crossfilter","'DC.js is a javascript charting library with native crossfilter support, allowing highly efficient exploration on large multi-dimensional datasets (inspired by crossfilter's demo).

As the Parent element is nested in a bootstrap row, the widths are calculated via bootstrap grid and there is no need to hard code.
