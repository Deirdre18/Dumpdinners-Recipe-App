This project is my 3rd Milestone Project for Full-Stack Diploma in Software Development. It is the second last project for completion of this course. It is a Data Centric Project, using Python, Flask, MongoDB, HTML5, CSS3, Materialise CSS and some Bootstrap. I found the recipes from websites and added them to database, as well as registered users.
