/*please note there maybe some code here that was not used in this project, as I initially added some code, that changed later but most of the code in this stylesheet does refer to the DumpDinners project. */

/*please note also I have put a lot of styling in base.html. Due to CSS rules for precedence, puting code under <style> tags in base.html was the most approrpriate place rather than in this stylesheet. */
